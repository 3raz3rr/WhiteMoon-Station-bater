	desc = "A no-nonsense, battle-proven rig designed for operators who prefer their gear rugged, modular, and drenched in the faint smell of gun oil and bad decisions. This hybrid harness combines MOLLE precision with ALICE simplicity—because when you're knee-deep in a maintenance tunnel brawl, you don’t have time to admire your own loadout. The worn leather holster on the hip suggests a previous owner who believed in ‘shoot first, file paperwork never.’"
